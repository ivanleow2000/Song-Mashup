# Song-Mashup
# Separate vocals from a song and background music from another and mash them together.

It's kinda bad lmao. See "GOOD PARTS.txt".

For the final product to sound good, the 2 songs have to have the same or matching key. BPM also has to be the same.
After looking for songs that could match for abit, I got bored.

Could look into packages that can alter keys and BPM of songs then mash them together?
